## Core Features in Detail

### Image Uploader & Queue
- **Multi-File Upload**: Supports uploading multiple images at once via drag-and-drop or file selection.
- **Image Queue**: All uploaded images are displayed in a thumbnail strip at the bottom. This allows for easy navigation between images and serves as the selection pool for the collage creator.

### Main Editing Suite
The core of the application, offering three primary editing modes that can be applied in a batch process.

- **Cleanup Only**: A non-invasive mode that performs a light touch-up. It uses AI to identify and remove minor imperfections like dust, scratches, compression artifacts, and blemishes while preserving the original image's integrity.
- **Remove Background**: Intelligently segments the main subject from its background. The output is a high-quality PNG with a transparent background, perfect for layering or product showcases.
- **Themed Background**: The most powerful mode. It removes the original background and replaces it with a new one generated by AI based on a user-provided text prompt (e.g., "a futuristic cityscape at night").
    - **Harmonize Subject Style**: An optional enhancement within this mode that adjusts the subject's lighting, color temperature, and texture to blend seamlessly and realistically with the new AI-generated background.

### Auto-Crop Engine
- **Composition-Aware Cropping**: Instead of simple center-cropping, the AI analyzes the image to suggest crops based on established photographic rules like the **Rule of Thirds**, **leading lines**, and subject headroom.
- **Multiple Aspect Ratios**: Users can select common aspect ratios (e.g., 1:1 for Instagram, 16:9 for thumbnails).
- **Scored Proposals**: The engine returns up to three crop proposals for each selected aspect ratio, complete with a **composition score (1-100)** and a brief **rationale** explaining the AI's decision-making process.

### AI Filters
- **One-Click Styles**: Apply artistic filters to any image with a single click. Presets include styles like "Vintage Film," "Noir," and "Cyberpunk Glow."
- **Custom Prompts**: For complete creative control, users can write their own text prompt to define a unique filter style (e.g., "A dreamy, ethereal glow with high saturation"). The AI interprets the prompt and transforms the image accordingly.

### Artistic Collage Creator
- **Multi-Image Input**: Users can select two or more images from the queue.
- **Thematic Generation**: By providing a theme (e.g., "a surreal, dreamlike landscape with pastel colors"), users guide the AI to generate a single, cohesive collage that artistically blends the selected images.

### Social Post Generator
- **Context-Aware Captions**: Generates engaging captions for platforms like Instagram and Twitter/X. Users can provide optional context (e.g., "announcing a summer sale") to ensure the posts are relevant.
- **Hashtags & Music**: The AI automatically suggests relevant hashtags. For Instagram posts, it also provides **three song suggestions** (title and artist) perfect for Reels or Stories.
- **Bilingual Support**: Captions can be generated in both **English** and **Italian**.

### MakerWorld Post Generator
- **Specialized for 3D Printing**: This tool is tailored for creating posts for 3D printing communities.
- **Structured Output**: It generates a complete, well-formatted post including:
    - **Model Name**
    - **Category**
    - **Tags** (relevant keywords for searchability)
    - **Detailed Description** (using markdown and emojis for engagement)
    - **Short Community Post** (a concise version for quick sharing)
- **Bilingual Support**: Posts can be generated in both **English** and **Italian**.
